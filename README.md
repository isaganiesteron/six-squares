# React + Vite + Material UI

This is a little project suitable for junior devs.

## Requirements:

-   Build six squares with no color
-   Every time you click one, it turns green
-   When the last square turns green, they all go back to no color in backwards sequence to which it was clicked (not all at once)

## Bonus Features:

-   Clicking on a green square will reset it's color
-   Add a label to a square when it turns green to follow the order it resets
